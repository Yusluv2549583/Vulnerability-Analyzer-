# SQL Vulnerability-Analyzer-

Here's how you can explain the scanning process and the inputs involved:

### Overview of the Scanning Process

The program is designed to scan a website for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by analyzing its forms. It interacts with the web page in a way similar to how a user would, but instead of simply submitting the forms, it tests them with various SQL injection payloads to check if the website is vulnerable.

### Explanation of the Inputs Scanned

When the program scans a website, it looks for all the forms on that webpage. Forms on a webpage usually contain input fields where users can enter data, such as a login form with fields for a username and password, or a search form with a field for a search query.

- **Input Fields:** The inputs scanned by the program are indeed the input fields within the forms found on the webpage. These input fields might include text boxes, hidden fields, and text areas where users typically enter data.
- **Name of the Input Fields:** Yes, the program also captures the names of these input fields. The "name" attribute of an input field is important because it tells the server what kind of data is being submitted. For example, in a login form, the input fields might have names like "username" and "password." The program extracts these names to identify which field is being tested.

### How the Program Tests for Vulnerability

Once the program identifies the forms and their input fields, it uses a series of SQL injection payloads (like `"' OR 1=1 --"`) to see if the website improperly handles or executes these inputs.

- **Injection Testing:** It sends these payloads through each input field in the form, simulating what might happen if a malicious user tried to exploit the website. If the server responds with certain error messages or behaves in a way that suggests it's vulnerable, the program marks that input field as vulnerable.

### Example of What the Input Scans Mean

For each input scanned, the program provides a result that indicates whether that input field is vulnerable to SQL injection. Here's what each part means:

- **Input Name:** The identifier of the field that was tested (e.g., "username" or "search").
- **Input Value:** The value that was injected into the field during the test (e.g., an SQL injection payload like `"' OR 1=1"`).
- **Vulnerable:** A boolean value (`True` or `False`) that indicates whether the field was found to be vulnerable to SQL injection.

### Displaying the Results

When the scan is complete, the results are displayed on a webpage. The webpage shows:

- The URL of the website that was scanned.
- A list of forms and input fields that were tested, along with an indication of whether each input field is vulnerable.
- An explanation of what the results mean, helping the user understand which parts of their website might need attention.

This explanation should give a clear understanding of how the program operates, what the inputs are, and how vulnerabilities are detected.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Starting the server

Navigate (cd) to the backend directory and run this code on the terminal

```bash
python app.py
```
